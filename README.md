# Option Pricing Model Project

**GitHub Repo:** [https://github.com/MeridianAlgo/Option-Pricing-Research](https://github.com/MeridianAlgo/Option-Pricing-Research)

**Made with love by the MeridianAlgo Algorithmic Research Team (Quantum Meridian)**

A fully automated, quant-grade option pricing and research platform. Input a stock ticker, and the system fetches all data, computes prices using advanced models (Black-Scholes, Binomial, Monte Carlo, Heston, Merton, SABR, Variance Gamma, exotics), and provides ML-based pricing with PyTorch (MLP, LSTM, Transformer, blending, auto-retraining). Batch pricing, scenario analysis, full Greeks, risk metrics, RL for hedging, generative models, explainable AI dashboards, auto-documentation, research collaboration, and robust integration testing are all included.

## üöÄ Features

- **Automated Data Fetching**: Just provide a ticker, and all market data is fetched automatically (price, volatility, option chain, risk-free rate).
- **Advanced Pricing Models**: Black-Scholes, Binomial, Monte Carlo, Heston (stochastic volatility), Merton (jump diffusion), SABR, Variance Gamma, and more.
- **Exotic Options**: American, Asian, Barrier, Lookback, and more.
- **Machine Learning Pricing**: PyTorch-based neural networks (MLP, LSTM, Transformer), model blending, auto-retraining, and explainability (SHAP).
- **Reinforcement Learning**: RL agents for hedging and trading (scaffolded for future research).
- **Generative Models**: For volatility surface and scenario generation (scaffolded for future research).
- **Batch & Scenario Analysis**: Price entire option chains, run stress tests, and scenario analysis.
- **Full Greeks & Risk Metrics**: Delta, Gamma, Vega, Theta, Rho, Vomma, Vanna, VaR, CVaR, and more.
- **Diagnostics & Outlier Detection**: Error analysis, arbitrage checks, model fit stats, and robust integration tests.
- **Quant-Grade Reporting**: Export results to CSV, Excel, and generate interactive plots and diagnostics.
- **Explainable AI Dashboards**: Streamlit dashboard with session saving, sharing, annotation, and multi-user support.
- **Auto-Documentation & Collaboration**: Jupyter notebook template export, research automation, and collaboration tools.
- **Cloud/Distributed Computing**: Batch/scenario/Monte Carlo jobs on cloud or clusters (scaffolded for future research).
- **Extensible API**: Use as CLI, Python API, or batch mode. Modular for research and production.

## üìã Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- NumPy
- SciPy
- Matplotlib
- Pandas
- yfinance
- requests
- torch
- scikit-learn
- streamlit
- pyyaml
- (Optional: shap, dask, ray, jupyter)

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. Clone or download the project files
2. Install required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üéØ Usage

### Automated Pricing

```bash
python auto_pricer.py AAPL
```
- Fetches all data and prices all options for AAPL, saving results to CSV.

### Programmatic Usage

```python
from option_pricing import OptionPricing
from data import get_stock_price, get_option_chain, get_historical_prices, get_risk_free_rate

S = get_stock_price('AAPL')
K = 150
T = 0.25
r = get_risk_free_rate()
sigma = 0.2
option = OptionPricing(S, K, T, r, sigma, 'call')
price, delta, gamma, theta, vega, rho, vomma, vanna = option.black_scholes()
```

### Machine Learning Pricing

```python
from ml_model import fit_ml_model, fit_lstm_model, fit_transformer_model, blend_models
# X, y = ... # Prepare your features and target (option prices)
model, scaler = fit_ml_model(X, y)
predictions = model(torch.tensor(scaler.transform(X), dtype=torch.float32)).detach().numpy().flatten()
```

### Dashboard

```bash
streamlit run dashboard.py
```

### Batch/Cloud/Distributed
- See `config.yaml` and `cloud_batch.py` for batch and distributed job support.
